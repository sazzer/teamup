## World Size

Faerun is ~ 4000 x 6000 Km
This is 400,000 x 600,000 m

Assuming that we store the heightmap with one byte per cell. That allows for 256 steps in height. 

Everest is 8,848m in height, which would need each step to be 35m.

* If we stored the heightmap at a 1x1m level, this is 400,000 * 600,000 bytes = 240,000,000,000 bytes = 223 GB of memory.
* If we stored the heightmap at a 10x10m level, this is 40,000 * 60,000 bytes = 2,400,000,000 bytes = 2.2 GB of memory.
* If we stored the heightmap at a 100x100m level, this is 4,000 * 4,000 bytes = 24,000,000 bytes = 23 MB of memory.

However. Apparently the average hiking speed for someone who is experienced at this is 20 Km per day, so a world the size of Faerun would take 200 days = 7 months to hike the short side, or 300 days = 10 months to hike the long side. This is an excessively long time.

By comparison: (http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/615805-/61236158)
* Skyrim Tamriel is 6.9 x 5.4 Km in size.
* Oblivion Cyrodill is 7.7 x 7.4 Km in size.
* Morrowind Vvardenfell is 4.8 x 5 Km in size.
* Fallout 3 Wasteland is 11.3 x 11.5 Km in size.
* Fallout 3 New Vegas is 7.3 x 7.4 Km in size.

Each of these can be hiked, under ideal circumstances, in half a day along each side. 

By these numbers, if we stored the heightmap at a 1x1m level:

* Skyrim Tamriel, this is 6,900 * 5,400 = 37,260,000 bytes = 36 MB of memory.
* Oblivion Cyrodill, this is 7,700 * 7,400 = 56,980,000 bytes = 54 MB of memory.
* Morrowind Vvardenfell, this is 4,800 * 5,000 = 24,000,000 bytes = 23 MB of memory
* Fallout 3 Wasteland, this is 11,300 * 11,500 = 1,299,500,000 bytes = 1.2 GB of memory.
* Fallout 3 New Vegas, this is 7,300 * 7,400 = 54,020,000 bytes = 52 MB of memory.

This means we can reasonably store the heights in 2 bytes instead of 1, which allows for 65536 steps in height.

Everest is 8,848m in height, which would thus need each step to be 13cm.

This we can store a world that is the size of Oblivion or Fallout 3 New Vegas, with 8 height steps per metre, in ~100 MB and still have a mountain the height of Everest represented. More likely we would either use a larger height step, or just have shallower mountains, and use half of the range to represent depths as well.

To make a real world comparison, Sheffield is 367 Km^2, which would be 20 Km to a side if it were square. Chesterfield is 66 Km^2, which would be 8 Km to a side. This means that none of the Bethesda worlds above are the size of Sheffield, and Fallout 3 New Vegas is comparable to Chesterfield.

The area of Yorkshire is 11,903 Km^2, which would be 109 Km to a side. Working this out at 1 byte per cell would be.

* 1m x 1m = 11,903,000,000 bytes = 11 GB of memory
* 5m x 5m = 476,120,000 bytes = 454 MB of memory
* 10m x 10m = 119,030,000 bytes = 113 MB of memory
